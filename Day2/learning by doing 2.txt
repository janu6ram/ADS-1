b, c, d. cannot occur.
In queue First in First out.

b)  4 6 8 7 5 3 2 9 0 1
 in this case 4 enters before 5.So when we dequeue 
4 deletes first than 5. But in this sequence 5 is missing.

c) 2 5 6 7 4 8 9 3 1 0 
In this sequence 3 and 4 are missing although 2 is there.

d) 4 3 2 1 0 5 6 7 8 9
 In this case the sequence reverse order this is also not possible
